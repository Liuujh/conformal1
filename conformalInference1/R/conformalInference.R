#' Tools for conformal inference in regression
#'
#' A collection of tools for distribution-free inference for regression problems
#'   using the theory of conformal prediction. 
#'
#' Conformal inference is a framework for converting any pre-chosen estimator of
#'   the regression function into prediction intervals with finite-sample
#'   validity, under essentially no assumptions on the data-generating process
#'   (aside from the the assumption of i.i.d. observations). The main functions
#'   in this package for computing such prediction intervals are
#'   \code{\link{conformal.pred}} (shorter intervals, but more expensive) and
#'   \code{\link{conformal.pred.split}} (wider intervals, but much more
#'   efficient).
